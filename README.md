# CS-300-Analysis-and-Design

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

This project involved making a program that reads an Excel file and allows for searching within the dataset. 
The problem I faced was analyzing the performance of various data structures to find the most efficient one in terms of speed and memory usage. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

First, I had to understand the requirements for this project and the problem statement.
When I fully understood the task the at hand with its limits, I moved on to measure data structures in order to find the best one for the project.
Keeping a detailed log helped me understand that different data structures have other qualities that must be considered before using them. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

If one used a small file sample, the measurements would be so close together that it would be hard to find noticeable differences. 
By using a larger sample size, different qualities of a structure are more noticeable. 
Keeping detailed notes when interacting with these data structures helped when it was time to implement them. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

After learning about data structures and algorithms, I understand that no perfect object works for any situation.
One must take the time and weigh the benefits and drawbacks before committing to one.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The more programs I write, the more I understand why it is important to write clear, reusable code with detailed comments.
Revisiting the code after time has passed can be difficult if there are no comments to help find the section you're looking for. 
As time goes on, it is necessary to update code with new features and ensure that it is still relevant for its purpose.
Having code that can be reused helps cut the time it takes to develop programs and, in turn, saves money.
